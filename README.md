### Instructions:

* The app's current functionality includes the usage of four apis; accessing local storage data, Nasa api, weather api, and news api.  
* The tabs across the top of the screen reflect a second phase of development which include adding a server and database making it a fullstack app.  The database would hold the userdata allowing it to persist even when the local storage has been deleted. 
* The app would allow the user to login and retrieve their user-specific data.
